## Summary

In-protocol meta transactions allowing for third-party account to initiate and pay transactions on behalf of the account.

## Motivation

NEAR has been designed with simplifiy of onboarding in mind. One of the large hurdles right now is that after creating an implicit or even named account user doesn't have NEAR to pay gas fees to interact with apps.
Such apps can include an app that actually would pay user (like NEARCrowd or Sweatcoin).

## Rationale and alternatives

Proposed here design provides the easiest for users and developers way to onboard and pay for user transactions.
There is no requirement on the user account, including user account may not even exist on chain and implicit account can be used.

Alterantive is proxy contracts deployed on the user account. 
This design has severe limitations as it requires user to deploy such contract and additional costs for storage.

## Specification

Next changes to protocol are required:
 - New Action kind: `DelegateAction(receiver_id, Action, signer_pk, signature)`
 - On conversion to Receipt, such action is sent as `DelegateAction` to the `receiver_id`.
 - On processing Receipt, it verifies the `signature` over the given account and `signer_pk`. Unwraps into `receiver_id: AccountId`, `action: Action` inside into new Receipt with given `receiver_id` and `action`. This means that `predeccessor_id` of such action has been overriden.

See the changes in the protocol specification for details.

## Security Implications (Optional)

Biggest consideration to discuss, if `signer_id` should be overriden by `DelegateAction`.
There are pros and cons to this.

Another consideration is the format of signature for `DelegateAction` that user should provide. This is to ensure security of such operation, at the same time it can be just a Transaction format.

## Drawbacks (Optional)

Increases complexity of the NEAR's transactional model.

## Unresolved Issues (Optional)

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the NEP process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this NEP that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this NEP?

## Future possibilities

One specific way to expand is to allow ZK proofs be included instead of just a user signature.
This would allow to hide who is initiating transaction while still overriding the `predeccessor` for the contracts.
